# SQL

This project aims to connect Python to multiple RDBMS software (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) using database drivers (Psycopg2, MySQL-connector, Sqlite3) and to perform SQL queries against those databases.

This repo contains the code for a few examples from [SQL Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-cookbook-2nd/9781492077435/), by Anthony Molinaro, Robert de Graaf. O'Reilly, 2020.
